Tetris README!!!

Overview:
	I made an app class, paneorganizer class, game class, piece class, square class, and a constants class. Game was a subclass of paneorganizer 
	and square was a wrapper class that was used in my piece class. My paneorganizer handled where things were positioned on the screen, 
	the game handler handled the logic, and the piece class had a lot of methods that were used in the game class to make sure the piece could move.
	My square class had a lot of methods used in the piece class. All of these methods and the ways 
	that these different classes interacted are specified in detail in my headers. 

Design Choices:
	For this project, I only decided to do one of the extra credit options.
	I created a score that keeps track each time a row a removed. Each row removed
	adds 100 points to the score.
